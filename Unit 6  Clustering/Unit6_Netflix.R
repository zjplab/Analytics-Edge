# After following the steps in the video, load the data into R
movies = read.table("movieLens.txt", header=FALSE, sep="|",quote="\"")

str(movies)

# Add column names
colnames(movies) = c("ID", "Title", "ReleaseDate", "VideoReleaseDate", "IMDB", "Unknown", "Action", "Adventure", "Animation", "Childrens", "Comedy", "Crime", "Documentary", "Drama", "Fantasy", "FilmNoir", "Horror", "Musical", "Mystery", "Romance", "SciFi", "Thriller", "War", "Western")

str(movies)

# Remove unnecessary variables
movies$ID = NULL
movies$ReleaseDate = NULL
movies$VideoReleaseDate = NULL
movies$IMDB = NULL

# Remove duplicates
movies = unique(movies)

# Take a look at our data again:
str(movies)



# Video 7

# Compute distances
distances = dist(movies[2:20], method = "euclidean")

# Hierarchical clustering
clusterMovies = hclust(distances, method = "ward.D")

# Plot the dendrogram
plot(clusterMovies)

# Assign points to clusters
clusterGroups = cutree(clusterMovies, k = 10)

#Now let's figure out what the clusters are like.

# Let's use the tapply function to compute the percentage of movies in each genre and cluster

tapply(movies$Action, clusterGroups, mean)
tapply(movies$Romance, clusterGroups, mean)

# We can repeat this for each genre. If you do, you get the results in ClusterMeans.ods


# Find which cluster Men in Black is in.

subset(movies, Title=="Men in Black (1997)")
clusterGroups[257]

# Create a new data set with just the movies from cluster 2
cluster2 = subset(movies, clusterGroups==2)

# Look at the first 10 titles in this cluster:
cluster2$Title[1:10]
# 
# 
# In this video, we explain how you can find the cluster centroids by using the function "tapply" for each variable in the dataset. While this approach works and is familiar to us, it can be a little tedious when there are a lot of variables. An alternative approach is to use the colMeans function. With this approach, you only have one command for each cluster instead of one command for each variable. If you run the following command in your R console, you can get all of the column (variable) means for cluster 1:
#   
#   colMeans(subset(movies[2:20], clusterGroups == 1))
# 
# You can repeat this for each cluster by changing the clusterGroups number. However, if you also have a lot of clusters, this approach is not that much more efficient than just using the tapply function.
# 
# A more advanced approach uses the "split" and "lapply" functions. The following command will split the data into subsets based on the clusters:
#   
#   spl = split(movies[2:20], clusterGroups)
# 
# Then you can use spl to access the different clusters, because
# 
# spl[[1]]
# 
# is the same as
# 
# subset(movies[2:20], clusterGroups == 1)
# 
# so colMeans(spl[[1]]) will output the centroid of cluster 1. But an even easier approach uses the lapply function. The following command will output the cluster centroids for all clusters:
#   
#   lapply(spl, colMeans)
# 
# The lapply function runs the second argument (colMeans) on each element of the first argument (each cluster subset in spl). So instead of using 19 tapply commands, or 10 colMeans commands, we can output our centroids with just two commands: one to define spl, and then the lapply command.
# 
# Note that if you have a variable called "split" in your current R session, you will need to remove it with rm(split) so that you can use the split function.
